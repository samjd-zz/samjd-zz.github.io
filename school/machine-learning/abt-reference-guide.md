# Analytical Base Table (ABT) Quick Reference Guide

## What is an ABT?

An Analytical Base Table is a denormalized, flat data structure that consolidates all relevant features and target variables into a single table, optimized for machine learning and predictive analytics workflows. Each row represents a unique observation (entity/event), and each column represents a feature or target variable.

## Core Components

### 1. Entity/Grain Definition
- **Primary Key**: Unique identifier for each row (customer_id, transaction_id, etc.)
- **Grain Level**: The unit of analysis (customer-level, transaction-level, session-level)
- **Time Component**: Point-in-time snapshot or observation window

### 2. Target Variable
- **Binary Classification**: 0/1 outcomes (churn, fraud, conversion)
- **Multi-class**: Multiple categorical outcomes
- **Regression**: Continuous values (revenue, LTV, duration)
- **Time-to-Event**: Survival analysis targets

### 3. Feature Categories
- **Demographic**: Age, gender, location, occupation
- **Behavioral**: Usage patterns, frequency metrics, engagement scores
- **Transactional**: Purchase history, monetary values, recency metrics
- **Temporal**: Time-based features, seasonality indicators, trends
- **Derived**: Ratios, aggregations, transformations, interaction terms
- **External**: Third-party data, economic indicators, weather data

## Design Principles

### Temporal Consistency
- **No Data Leakage**: Features must only use data available before the prediction point
- **Observation Window**: Historical period for feature calculation
- **Performance Window**: Future period for target variable measurement
- **Gap Period**: Buffer between observation and performance windows (prevents leakage)

### Feature Engineering Best Practices

**Aggregation Strategies**
- Count, sum, average, min, max, standard deviation
- Recency, frequency, monetary (RFM) metrics
- Rolling windows (7-day, 30-day, 90-day aggregates)
- Lag features (previous period values)
- Trend indicators (slope, acceleration)

**Handling Different Data Types**
- **Numerical**: Scaling, normalization, binning, polynomial features
- **Categorical**: One-hot encoding, target encoding, embedding
- **Temporal**: Cyclical encoding (sin/cos for day of week, month)
- **Text**: TF-IDF, word embeddings, sentiment scores
- **Missing Values**: Imputation strategies, missingness indicators

## Common ABT Patterns by Use Case

### Customer Churn Prediction
```
customer_id | tenure | avg_monthly_spend | days_since_last_purchase | support_tickets | ... | churned
```
- Observation: 12 months of history
- Gap: 1 month
- Target: Churn in next 3 months

### Fraud Detection
```
transaction_id | amount | merchant_category | time_since_last_txn | unusual_location | ... | is_fraud
```
- Observation: Real-time + historical patterns
- Gap: None (real-time scoring)
- Target: Fraudulent transaction

### Lead Scoring
```
lead_id | source | industry | company_size | engagement_score | days_in_funnel | ... | converted
```
- Observation: All interactions until scoring date
- Gap: None
- Target: Conversion within 30 days

## Data Quality Considerations

### Validation Checks
- **Completeness**: Missing value percentages per feature
- **Consistency**: Data type validation, range checks
- **Uniqueness**: Primary key duplication check
- **Timeliness**: Data freshness and update frequency
- **Accuracy**: Outlier detection, distribution analysis

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Target Leakage**: Using future information in features
- **Survivorship Bias**: Only including successful outcomes
- **Sample Selection Bias**: Non-representative training data
- **Class Imbalance**: Skewed target distribution
- **Multicollinearity**: Highly correlated features
- **Overfitting**: Too many features relative to observations

## Implementation Workflow

### 1. Data Collection Phase
- Identify all relevant data sources
- Define join keys and relationships
- Establish data refresh schedules
- Document data lineage

### 2. Feature Development Phase
- Create feature specifications
- Build transformation pipelines
- Test feature calculations
- Version control feature definitions

### 3. ABT Assembly Phase
- Execute joins and aggregations
- Apply temporal filters
- Generate train/validation/test splits
- Create point-in-time snapshots

### 4. Quality Assurance Phase
- Run data quality checks
- Validate temporal consistency
- Check for data leakage
- Profile feature distributions

## Advanced Techniques

### Feature Store Integration
- Centralized feature repository
- Feature versioning and lineage
- Real-time feature serving
- Feature sharing across models

### Incremental Updates
- Delta processing for new data
- Sliding window updates
- Feature backfilling strategies
- Change data capture (CDC)

### Scalability Considerations
- Partitioning strategies (by date, entity)
- Columnar storage formats (Parquet, ORC)
- Distributed processing (Spark, Dask)
- Sampling techniques for large datasets

## Performance Optimization

### Computational Efficiency
- Pre-compute expensive aggregations
- Use materialized views
- Implement caching strategies
- Optimize join operations

### Storage Optimization
- Column selection (remove low-value features)
- Data type optimization
- Compression techniques
- Archival strategies for old data

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Feature Drift Detection
- Distribution shift monitoring
- Statistical tests (KS, PSI, Wasserstein)
- Feature importance tracking
- Model performance degradation alerts

### Documentation Requirements
- Feature definitions and business logic
- Data source dependencies
- Calculation examples
- Update frequency and SLAs

## Tools and Technologies

### Data Processing
- **SQL**: Complex aggregations and joins
- **Python**: Pandas, PySpark, Dask
- **R**: data.table, dplyr
- **Spark**: Large-scale distributed processing

### Feature Stores
- Feast, Tecton, Hopsworks, AWS SageMaker Feature Store

### Orchestration
- Airflow, Prefect, Dagster, Luigi

### Version Control
- DVC (Data Version Control), Git LFS, Delta Lake

## Key Metrics for ABT Quality

- **Coverage**: % of population with complete features
- **Recency**: Average age of data in features
- **Cardinality**: Unique values per categorical feature
- **Correlation**: Feature correlation matrix analysis
- **Information Value**: Predictive power of features
- **Variance Inflation Factor**: Multicollinearity detection
